        <dc:description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Amazon.com Review&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2011:&lt;/strong&gt; Even among authors, Jeffrey Eugenides possesses a rare talent for being able to inhabit his characters. In &lt;em&gt;The Marriage Plot&lt;/em&gt;, his third novel and first in ten years (following the Pulitzer Prize-winning &lt;em&gt;Middlesex&lt;/em&gt;), Eugenides describes a year or so in the lives of three college seniors at Brown in the early 80s. There is Madeleine, a self-described “incurable romantic” who is slightly embarrassed at being so normal. There is Leonard, a brilliant, temperamental student from the Pacific Northwest. And completing the triangle is Mitchell, a Religious Studies major from Eugenides’ own Detroit. What follows is a book delivered in sincere and genuine prose, tracing the end of the students’ college days and continuing into those first, tentative steps toward true adulthood. This is a thoughtful and at times disarming novel about life, love, and discovery, set during a time when so much of life seems filled with deep portent. &lt;em&gt;--Chris Schluep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Review&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Praise for &lt;em&gt;The Marriage Plot&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eugenides's first novel since 2002's Pulitzer Prize–winning &lt;em&gt;Middlesex&lt;/em&gt; so impressively, ambitiously breaks the mold of its predecessor that it calls for the founding of a new prize to recognize its success both as a novel—and as a Jeffrey Eugenides novel. Importantly but unobtrusively set in the early 1980s, this is the tale of Madeleine Hanna, recent Brown University English grad, and her admirer Mitchell Grammaticus, who opts out of Divinity School to walk the earth as an ersatz pilgrim. Madeleine is equally caught up, both with the postmodern vogue (Derrida, Barthes)—conflicting with her love of James, Austen, and Salinger—and with the brilliant Leonard Bankhead, whom she met in semiotics class and whose fits of manic depression jeopardize his suitability as a marriage prospect. Meanwhile, Mitchell winds up in Calcutta working with Mother Theresa's volunteers, still dreaming of Madeleine. In capturing the heady spirit of youthful intellect on the verge, Eugenides revives the coming-of-age novel for a new generation The book's fidelity to its young heroes and to a superb supporting cast of enigmatic professors, feminist theorists, neo-Victorians, and concerned mothers, and all of their evolving investment in ideas and ideals is such that the central argument of the book is also its solution: the old stories may be best after all, but there are always new ways to complicate them.” —&lt;em&gt;Publisher’s Weekly&lt;/em&gt; (starred review)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In Eugenides’ first novel since the Pulitzer Prize–winning &lt;em&gt;Middlesex&lt;/em&gt; (2002), English major and devotee of classic literature Madeleine Hanna is a senior at Reagan-era Brown University. Only when curiosity gets the best of her does she belly up to Semiotics 211, a bastion of postmodern liberalism, and meet handsome, brilliant, mysterious Leonard Bankhead. Completing a triangle is Madeleine’s friend Mitchell, a clear-eyed religious-studies student who believes himself her true intended. Eugenides’ drama unfolds over the next year or so. His characteristically deliberate, researched realization of place and personality serve him well, and he strikes perfectly tuned chords by referring to works ranging from Barthes’ &lt;em&gt;Lovers’ Discourse&lt;/em&gt; to Bemelmans’ &lt;em&gt;Madeline&lt;/em&gt; books for children. The remarkably à propos title refers to the subject of Madeleine’s honors thesis, which is the Western novel’s doing and undoing, in that, upon the demise, circa 1900, of the marriage plot, the novel ‘didn’t mean much anymore,’ according to Madeleine’s professor and, perhaps, Eugenides. With this tightly, immaculately self-contained tale set upon pillars at once imposing and of dollhouse scale, namely, academia (‘College wasn’t like the real world,’ Madeleine notes) and the emotions of the youngest of twentysomethings, Eugenides realizes the novel whose dismantling his characters examine.” &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt;Annie Bostrom, &lt;em&gt;Booklist&lt;/em&gt; (starred review)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A stunning novel—erudite, compassionate and penetrating in its analysis of love relationships. Eugenides focuses primarily on three characters, who all graduate from Brown in 1982. One of the pieces of this triangle is Madeleine Hanna, who finds herself somewhat embarrassed to have emerged from a “normal” household in New Jersey (though we later find out the normality of her upbringing is only relative). She becomes enamored with Leonard, a brilliant but moody student, in their Semiotics course, one of the texts being, ironically, Roland Barthes’ &lt;em&gt;A Lover’s Discourse&lt;/em&gt;, which Madeleine finds disturbingly problematic in helping her figure out her own love relationship. We discover that Leonard had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder during his first year at Brown, and his struggle with mood swings throughout the novel is both titanic and tender. The third major player is Mitchell, a Religious Studies major who is also attracted to Madeleine but whose reticence she finds both disturbing and incomprehensible. On graduation day, Leonard has a breakdown and is hospitalized in a mental-health ward, and Madeleine shows her commitment by skipping the festivities and seeking him out. After graduation, Leonard and Madeleine live together when Leonard gets an internship at a biology lab on Cape Cod, and the spring after graduation they marry, when Leonard is able to get his mood swings under temporary control. Meanwhile Mitchell, who takes his major seriously, travels to India seeking a path—and briefly finds one when he volunteers to work with the dying in Calcutta. But Mitchell’s road to self-discovery eventually returns him to the States—and opens another opportunity for love that complicates Madeleine’s life. Dazzling work—Eugenides continues to show that he is one of the finest of contemporary novelists.” —&lt;em&gt;Kirkus&lt;/em&gt; (starred review)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“‘The way of true love never works out, except at the end of an English novel.’ So says Trollope in Barchester Towers, one of those English novels where ‘the marriage plot’ thrived until it was swept aside by 20th-century reality. Now Roland Barthes’s contention that ‘the lover’s discourse is today of an extreme solitude’ better sums up the situation. Or so English literature–besotted Madeleine, 1980s Brown graduating senior, comes to discover. Giving in to the zeitgeist, Madeleine takes a course on semiotics and meets Leonard, who’s brilliant, charismatic, and unstable. They’ve broken up, which makes moody spiritual seeker Mitchell Grammaticus happy, since he pines for Madeleine. But on graduation day, Madeleine discovers that Leonard is in the hospital—in fact, he is a manic depressive with an on-again, off-again relationship with his medications—and leaps to his side. So begins the story of their love (but does it work out?), as Mitchell heads to Europe and beyond for his own epiphanies. VERDICT Your standard love triangle? Absolutely not. This extraordinary, liquidly written evocation of love’s mad rush and inevitable failures will feed your mind as you rapidly turn the pages. Highly recommended.” —Barbara Hoffert, &lt;em&gt;Library Journal&lt;/em&gt; (starred review)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Praise for &lt;em&gt;Middlesex&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Impressive . . . A deeply affecting portrait of one family’s tumultuous engagement with the American twentieth century.” —Michiko Ka kutani, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A towering achievement . . . [Eugenides] has emerged as the great American writer that many of us suspected him of being.” —Jeff Turrentine, &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Middlesex &lt;/em&gt;[is] deliriously American . . . A colossal act of curiosity, of imagination and of love.” —Laura Miller, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An epic . . . This feast of a novel is thrilling in the scope of its imagination and surprising in its tenderness.” —&lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A spirited, high-energy comic epic. At once remarkably readable, intelligent and moving, &lt;em&gt;Middlesex &lt;/em&gt;becomes that rare cultural hybrid, a page-turner that wows the critics.” —Dan Cryer, &lt;em&gt;Newsday&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At last Detroit has its great novel. What Dublin got from James Joyce—a sprawling, ambitious, loving, exasperated and playful chronicle of all its good and bad parts—Detroit has from native son Eugenides.” —Marta Salij, &lt;em&gt;Detroit Free Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</dc:description>
