        <dc:description>&lt;div class="blurb"&gt;Connor Fitzgerald is the professional's professional. Holder of 
the Medal of Honor. Devoted family man. Servant of his country. The CIA's most 
deadly weapon. But for the past twenty-eight years, Fitzgerald has been leading 
a double life. And only days from his retirement from the Agency, he comes 
across an enemy even he cannot handle. The enemy is his own boss, the Director 
of the CIA. And she has only one purpose: to destroy him. Meanwhile, the United 
States is faced with an equally formidable foe: a new Russian President, 
determined to force a military confrontation between the two superpowers. 
Ranging from the Oval Office in the White House to a Russian Mafia boss's 
luxurious hideaway outside St Petersburg, The Eleventh Commandment sets new 
standards in contemporary thriller writing. Jeffrey Archer scoops his readers up 
in the first paragraph, and doesn't let them go until the last. The pace, the 
ingenuity, the twists, intertwined with a moving love story, show Britain's 
bestselling writer at the peak of his page-turning powers.Â &lt;/div&gt;</dc:description>
